Sample Document for Chatbot

This is a sample text file to test document ingestion and appointment booking.

You can ask questions like:
- What is this document about?
- How can I book an appointment?
- Who should I contact to schedule a meeting?
- What information is required for booking?

To book an appointment, users are expected to provide:
- Full Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Preferred Date (e.g., Next Monday, 2025-07-01, or “tomorrow”)

The chatbot will guide users through a conversational form and validate their inputs to ensure correct contact details and date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

This file is designed to test both document Q&A and the appointment booking feature of the chatbot.
