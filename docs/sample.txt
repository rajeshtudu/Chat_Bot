Sample Appointment Information Document

This is a sample document designed to test document ingestion and appointment booking features in the chatbot.

You can ask questions like:
- What is this document about?
- How can I book an appointment?
- What information is required for booking?
- Who should I contact to schedule a meeting?
- When are appointments available?

To book an appointment, users must provide the following information:
- Full Name
- Phone Number (valid format: 10 digits)
- Email Address (e.g., user@example.com)
- Preferred Date (e.g., "Next Monday", "2025-07-01", or "tomorrow")

The chatbot will guide users through a conversational form and validate their inputs to ensure correct contact details and a proper date format (YYYY-MM-DD). 

Appointments are available:
- Monday to Friday: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00 AM – 2:00 PM
- Sunday: Closed

Users can cancel or reschedule appointments up to 3 hours in advance without penalty.
